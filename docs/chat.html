        <h1>Chat System with TRX Reward</h1>
        <p>Engage with the community and earn cryptocurrency rewards through our chat system! By being active in the chat, you can receive 0.1 TRX as a reward. Here’s how it works:</p>

        <h2>1. What is the Chat System?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Community Interaction:</strong> Our chat system allows you to engage with other users, ask questions, and share insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Earn TRX Rewards:</strong> To encourage active participation, users who send at least 2 messages in the last 5 minutes can be randomly selected to receive 0.1 TRX.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How to Participate</h2>
        <p>Participating in the chat is simple. Follow these steps to be eligible for TRX rewards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your account and join the chat room.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Send at least 2 meaningful messages within a 5-minute window.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Every 15 minutes, the system will randomly select 5 users who have sent at least 2 messages to receive 0.1 TRX each.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Reward Distribution</h2>
        <p>Once selected, the 0.1 TRX reward will be automatically credited to your balance. Here’s how the process works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Random Selection:</strong> Every 15 minutes, the system checks for users who have been active in the chat and selects 5 random participants.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Credit:</strong> If you’re selected, the 0.1 TRX will be automatically credited to your balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Your TRX balance is updated in real-time, and you can withdraw the amount or use it for staking.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Supported Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>The chat system rewards are distributed in <strong>TRX (Tron)</strong>. You can accumulate these rewards through active participation and use them in various ways on the platform.</p>

        <h2>5. How to Withdraw TRX</h2>
        <p>You can withdraw your earned TRX rewards instantly to your FaucetPay account. Here’s how:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <span class="highlight">Withdraw Section</span> in your dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select TRX as the withdrawal currency.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the amount of TRX you want to withdraw and submit the request. The funds will be instantly sent to your registered FaucetPay email address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Example Scenario</h2>
        <p>Here’s an example of how the chat system rewards work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You send at least 2 messages in the chat within a 5-minute period.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, the system randomly selects 5 users from those who have been active.</li>
            <li>If you’re selected, 0.1 TRX is automatically credited to your account.</li>
            <li>You can either withdraw the TRX or use it for staking to earn even more rewards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Important Rules</h2>
