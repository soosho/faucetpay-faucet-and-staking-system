        <h1>Staking System Overview</h1>
        <p>Our staking platform allows you to lock your cryptocurrency assets for a specific period in return for rewards. It's an easy and efficient way to grow your crypto holdings while contributing to the security and functionality of the platform. Here’s how it works:</p>

        <h2>1. Staking Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select Your Cryptocurrency:</strong> Choose from supported cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose a Staking Plan:</strong> Each plan has a specific lock period and a daily reward rate. The longer you lock your assets, the higher the potential rewards.
                <br>For example, a 30-day staking plan offers a 0.2% daily reward, while longer plans like 90 days may offer 0.5% daily.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lock Your Assets:</strong> Once you select the plan, your chosen cryptocurrency amount will be locked for the specified duration. You will not be able to withdraw the staked amount during this time, but you will earn rewards continuously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Real-Time Earnings and Withdrawals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Rewards:</strong> As soon as your assets are staked, you start earning rewards every second. Your balance is updated in real-time, so you can see your earnings increase every second on your dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Earnings Withdrawal:</strong> You can withdraw the earnings from your staking rewards at any time without waiting for the lock period to end. Your staked amount remains locked until the lock period expires.</li>
            <li><strong>Lock Period Ends:</strong> Once the staking period is complete, your original staked amount will be refunded to your balance, and you can withdraw or restake the amount as desired.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Funds Are Safe:</strong> All assets are securely locked during the staking period, and you can rest assured knowing that the platform takes extra measures to keep your assets safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Logs:</strong> Every staking and withdrawal action is logged, so you can track all of your staking activity, earnings, and withdrawals at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
        <p>Let's say you choose to stake 1,000 Dogecoins for a 30-day plan with a 0.2% daily reward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Reward:</strong> You’ll earn 2 Dogecoins every day (1,000 Dogecoin * 0.002).</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Your balance will increase by 0.00002315 Dogecoins every second, and you can withdraw these rewards at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Reward:</strong> After 30 days, you will have earned 60 Dogecoins, and your original 1,000 Dogecoins will be refunded to your balance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Staking Calculator</h2>
        <p>Use the calculator below to estimate your earnings based on the amount you want to stake, the staking period, and the daily reward rate.</p>
